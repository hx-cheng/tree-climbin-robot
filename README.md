# tree-climbing-robot

##Our final term project entails the design of a tree-climbing robot which is able to ascend a tree, deploy a sensor in its canopy, and finally return home safely. There will be a total of 3 varied scenarios that our robot has to complete, all of which test the limits and capabilities of our robot design. Our solution aims to focus on both the mechatronics and electronics that govern the design of our robot and how in conjunction with each other allow for the successful utilisation of our tree-climbing robot.
