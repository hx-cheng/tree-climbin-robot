# How to utilize this code for Tree-climbing Robot

## Project Summary
Our final term project entails the design of a tree-climbing robot which is able to ascend a tree, deploy a sensor in its canopy, and finally return home safely. There will be a total of 3 varied scenarios that our robot has to complete, all of which test the limits and capabilities of our robot design. Our solution aims to focus on both the mechatronics and electronics that govern the design of our robot and how in conjunction with each other allow for the successful utilisation of our tree-climbing robot.

## Environment Settings
The electronics components we used consisted of an Arduino R3 board as a microcontroller with an L298P motor driver equipped. The grippers and backbone are actuated by two servo motors and three DC motors respectively. Two ultrasonic sensors are used for the distance measurement and obstacle detection on either sides of the robot. The ‘obstacle’ here refers to the branches and rooftop in real cases.
Our robot program is written in Arduino IDE.
